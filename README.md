This is a complete application that includes a form-based authentication built with Spring Security. In case of a successful login if the user is not an admin it is redirected to the homepage where all the chats are displayed, also a websocket connection is established between a client and a server and it is implemented thanks to Spring Websocket. A user can choose a chat and send a text message to another user, Since websocket is just a communication protocol, it doesnâ€™t know how to send a message to a particular user. STOMP is a messaging protocol which is useful for these functionalities and that is used on the client. After the text message is sended it will be persisted in the MySQL Database.
